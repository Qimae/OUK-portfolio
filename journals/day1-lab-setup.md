# Day 1 – Setting Up My Cyber Lab

**Date:** 2025-01-15

Today I installed **Kali Linux**, **DVWA**, and **Metasploitable 2** in VirtualBox and configured an isolated host-only network for practice.

## Tools
- Kali Linux
- DVWA
- Metasploitable 2
- Burp Suite

## Notes
I used snapshots heavily — rollbacks are essential when intentionally breaking things.
